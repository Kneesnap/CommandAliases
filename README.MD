# CommandAliases
A very simple barebones Minecraft alias plugin that just works.  
Should support all versions of Spigot.  

I made this sometime in 2016.  
It's kind of a real mess / bad code quality, but I guess that's fine since it works and is super simple.  
I revisited it because I realized that there was a pretty important feature missing. It wasn't possible to have aliases with spaces in-game.

Maybe sometime I'll come back and update my other plugins too.
